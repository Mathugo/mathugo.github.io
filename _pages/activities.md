- **High energy physics and graph neural networks** <br> Studying applications of Graph Neural Networks to high energy physics, as a part of the [MUCCA project](https://mucca-project.github.io/) in collaboration with the University of Liverpool.


- **Deepers** <br> Member of the [Deepers](https://www.deepers.ai/) community. We aim at teaching Deep Learning to both developers and managers in the indutry, so that they can unlock AI's potential for business. [Here](https://github.com/alessiodevoto/deepers) you can find some of the *Deepers* Python tutorials.


- **Energy grids** <br> I worked with [**ENEL**](https://www.enel.it), Italy's largest energy supplier, and developed a model for object re-identification used to re-identify electrical lines. 


- **6G-GOALS** <br> Funded by the European Union, we use Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Goal and Semantic oriented communications. See [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07573) for more info.
