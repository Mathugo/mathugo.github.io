## Research

👨‍🎓 I am a [PhD student](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/ALESSIO-DEVOTO_nP1701081_IT.aspx) in Data Science at La Sapienza, University of Rome. 

🌱 Working with [Simone Scardapane](https://www.sscardapane.it) on developing efficient and interpretable machine learning models. 

🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Currently a visiting researcher at Edinburgh NLP with [Pasquale Minervini](https://neuralnoise.com/).

🔬 My research background spans both computer vision and natural language processing, focusing on making AI systems more efficient and interpretable. My current research interests include:
- Efficient training and inference for Language and Vision Models [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11430),[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08670)]
- AI explainability and mechanistic interpretability [[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15999)]
- Adaptive computation methods [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08670), [4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10193)]

### Blog 
📝 I maintain a small blog where I share code tutorials and insights on various deep learning topics, feel free to [take a look](https://alessiodevoto.github.io/blog/)!
