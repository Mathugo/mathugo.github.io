My research background spans both computer vision and natural language processing, with a focus on making AI systems more efficient and interpretable.

## Research

👨‍🎓 [PhD candidate](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/ALESSIO-DEVOTO_nP1701081_IT.aspx) in Data Science at La Sapienza, University of Rome. Working under the supervision of [Simone Scardapane](https://www.sscardapane.it) on developing efficient and interpretable machine learning models. 🌱

🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Visiting researcher at Edinburgh NLP, collaborating with [Pasquale Minervini](https://neuralnoise.com/) on natural language processing projects.


🔬 My research focuses on:
- Efficient training and inference for [Language]() and Vision Models
- AI interpretability 
- Adaptive computation methods
