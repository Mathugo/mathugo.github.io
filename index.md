## Research

üë®‚Äçüéì I am a [PhD student](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/fakultaet/fai/informatik/prof/mmc/team/hugo-math/) in Data Science at BMW Group associated with the [University of Augsburg](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/fakultaet/fai/informatik/prof/mmc/)

üöó Working on developing event sequence models alongside causal explaination for fault diagnostic in vehicles at BMW Group.

üî¨ My research background spans both Natural Language Processing and Causal Discovery, focusing on predicting and explaining occurence of discrete asynchronous events in dynamic systems such as vehicle diagnostics. My current research interests include efficient causal discovery techniques using pretrained Transformer models [[1]](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.23213),[[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19112) and event sequence modeling [[3]](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/34138).


## Beyond Research

- üá∏üá™ I spent an amazing semester as Erasmus student at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en), in Gothenburg, Sweden.
- üí° Former auto-entrepreneur, with multiple years of freelance mission in the semiconductor industry to automate wafer inspections using computer vision models.
