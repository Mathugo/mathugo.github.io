## Research

üë®‚Äçüéì I am a [PhD student](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/fakultaet/fai/informatik/prof/mmc/team/hugo-math/) in Data Science at BMW Group associated with the [University of Augsburg](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/fakultaet/fai/informatik/prof/mmc/) and advised by [Pr. Dr. Rainer Lienhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eKQPhGgAAAAJ&hl=fr).

üöó Working on developing event sequence models alongside causal explaination for fault diagnostic in vehicles at BMW Group.

üî¨ My research background spans both Natural Language Processing and Causal Discovery, focusing on predicting and explaining occurence of discrete asynchronous events in dynamic systems such as vehicle diagnostics. My current research interests include efficient causal discovery techniques using pretrained Transformer models [[1]](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.23213),[[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19112) and event sequence modeling [[3]](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/34138).

I'm open to relocate for a full time job/PhD intership in 2026.

## News

- September., 2025. Super happy to announce that two of my paper have been accepted to NeurIPS workshops on Structured Probabilistic & Generative Methods (SPIGM) and Uncovering Causality in Science (CauSien) ! I will be present to San Diego, USA in December and present them during the poster sessions. Don't hesitate to reach out ! 
- February., 2025. Thrilled to have presented during the poster session my first paper titled "Harnessing Event Sensory Data for Error Pattern Detection in Vehicles" at AAAI 2025 ! I had great discussions with other researcher regarding how to model spatio-temporal data, which are common in many areas such as the automotive industry.

## Beyond Research

- üá∏üá™ I spent an amazing semester as Erasmus student at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en), in Gothenburg, Sweden.
- üí° Former auto-entrepreneur, with multiple years of freelance mission in the semiconductor industry to automate wafer inspections using computer vision models.
