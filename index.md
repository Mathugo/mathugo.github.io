## Research

👨‍🎓 I am a [PhD student](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/ALESSIO-DEVOTO_nP1701081_IT.aspx) in Data Science at Sapienza University of Rome. 

🌱 Working on developing efficient and interpretable machine learning models with [Simone Scardapane](https://www.sscardapane.it).

🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Previously visiting researcher at Edinburgh NLP with [Pasquale Minervini](https://neuralnoise.com/).

🔬 My research background spans both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, focusing on making AI systems more efficient and interpretable. My current research interests include efficient training and inference for Language and Vision Models [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11430),[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08670)], AI Interpretability [[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15999), [4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03432)], Adaptive & Conditional Computation methods [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08670), [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10193)].

## Blog 
📝 I maintain a small blog where I share code tutorials and insights on various deep learning topics, feel free to [take a look](https://alessiodevoto.github.io/blog/)!

## Beyond Research

- 📈 Training as a certified Life & Business Coach [International Coaching Federation](https://coachingfederation.org)
- 🇪🇸 I spent an amazing semester as Erasmus student at [Universidad Politecnica de Valencia](http://www.upv.es/es), Spain.
- 🏛️ I like languages (even [dead ones!](https://www.sssscomic.com/comicpages/196.jpg)). I teach Ancient Greek and Latin to high school and college students.
